# ToDoApp
Hello!

## About
---
To-Doit is a To-Do List application that will allow you to track your day to day tasks. This project was made as a proof of concept where I am able to put together everything I've learned so far.
I've been working with frameworks such as BootStrap to design in addition to grid and flexbox in order to style a responsive website, while also using middlware such as express and ejs to create the backend structure of my app in order to make it dynamic.

## How To
---

### Today
---
The home page is the main view for creating tasks for your current day. Here you can enter a task name in the field labeled `Enter Task:` and if you have a time you need to complete this task by simply type in the time your task is due or
you can click on the clock icon which will allow a time popup to be displayed where you can then select the time due. Once done click submit and you have now created you first task on To-Doit!

### Week
---
The week page allows you to enter your tasks for the week, the process of creating a task is the same as the today view. The main difference this time around is you can specify what day a task needs to be completed by. Enter the number corresponding to the day
you would like to add your task to and once you click submit it will be succesfully added.

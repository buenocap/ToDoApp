# ToDoApp
Hello!

To-Doit is a To-Do List application that will allow you to track your day to day tasks. This project was made as a proof of concept where I am able to put together everything I've learned so far.
I've been working with frameworks such as BootStrap to design and style a responsive website while also using middlware such as express and ejs to create the backend structure of my app in order to make it dynamic.
